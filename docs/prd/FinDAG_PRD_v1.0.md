## 1. Overview

FinDAG is a high-performance, low-latency, deterministic blockchain system purpose-built for financial applications. **It is implemented in Rust for maximum safety, concurrency, and performance.** Leveraging a dual-layer Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure for both Blocks and Rounds, FinDAG achieves near real-time transaction finality, microsecond audit precision, and multi-million transactions per second (TPS) throughput.

- **No fees or rewards**
- **Ed25519** for address signatures
- **Automatic node discovery**
- **Authorized validation**: Only authorized nodes can validate blocks and rounds

---

## 2. Goals

- Achieve sub-second finality for all financial transactions
- Support 1M–10M TPS throughput without compromising ordering determinism
- Ensure regulatory compliance with precision timestamping
- Prevent front-running and improve fairness in high-frequency financial markets

## 4. Key Features

### 4.1 FinDAG Time & HashTimer

- Precise time synchronization with 100ns resolution
- Timestamp-based ordering for auditability and manipulation prevention
- **HashTimer is a two-part hash:**
  - The first part is 13–14 hex characters representing the FinDAG Time, which is the basis for chronologically organizing all transactions, blocks, and rounds. This provides precision up to 1/10 of a microsecond.
  - The second part is a cryptographic hash for deterministic ordering and time-lock logic

### 4.2 DAG-Based Block & Round Design

- Blocks form a DAG within micro-intervals (10–50ms)
- Rounds serve as checkpoint layers (~100–250ms) to finalize DAG paths
- Enables parallel block inclusion with global ordering

### 4.3 Finality in <500ms

- Deterministic finality within half a second
- Suitable for real-time financial systems and trading environments
- Eliminates ambiguity for settlement or regulatory audits

### 4.4 Skip-When-Empty Optimization

- Blocks omitted if no transactions are pending
- Maintains consistent timing without wasting network resources
- Dynamically adjusts to transaction flow

### 4.5 High Throughput

- Block size of 4–32KB (128KB max) for fast propagation
- ~250-byte transaction size allows 100+ tx per block
- Scales to millions of TPS across hundreds or thousands of nodes

### 4.6 Sharded In-RAM Transaction Pool

- The transaction pool (mempool) is fully in-memory and sharded for high throughput.
- Supports millions of transactions per second (TPS) by parallelizing across CPU cores.
- No disk persistence for the pool; only finalized blocks/rounds are persisted.
- Ensures low latency, deduplication, and prioritization by FinDAG Time.

### 4.7 Multi-Node Network Propagation

- FinDAG nodes support multi-node operation, each running on a unique network port and identified by a unique validator ID.
- Nodes connect to each other using a static peer list and propagate transactions, blocks, and rounds using a UDP-based gossip protocol.
- The network layer ensures all validator nodes receive and relay new data, enabling distributed consensus and high-throughput operation.
- The system is designed for easy multi-node testing and deployment, supporting both local and distributed setups.

## 11. Current Limitations & Next Steps for Production Readiness

While FinDAG's core protocol, high-throughput transaction pool, DAG engine, block/round production, and basic P2P networking are implemented, the following areas are recommended for full production deployment:

- **Advanced P2P Integration:** Complete integration of the libp2p-based P2P module for secure, scalable, and global peer discovery and messaging.
- **Message Validation & Security:** Add full signature, structure, and replay protection for all network messages. Implement rate limiting and peer scoring.
- **Dynamic Validator Set / Governance:** Support for dynamic validator membership, governance, or staking mechanisms.
- **Persistent Storage:** Add durable storage for blocks, rounds, and state (e.g., RocksDB, sled) to enable crash recovery and long-term auditability.
- **API/CLI:** Provide REST/gRPC APIs or CLI tools for transaction submission, state queries, and monitoring.
- **Consensus Hardening:** Consider BFT consensus algorithms for environments requiring Byzantine fault tolerance.
- **Monitoring & Observability:** Integrate with monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) for real-time metrics and alerting.
- **Deployment & DevOps:** Develop Docker/Kubernetes configs, CI/CD pipelines, and automated deployment scripts.
- **Documentation & Compliance:** Complete API documentation, operational runbooks, and compliance materials for regulatory audits.

These enhancements will ensure FinDAG is robust, secure, and ready for mission-critical financial deployments.

## 5. Use Cases

- **High-Frequency Trading (HFT):** Algorithmic trading with deterministic microsecond timing
- **Interbank Settlement:** Real-time clearing with <500ms latency
- **Tokenized Securities:** Precision audit trail for compliance
- **CBDC Infrastructure:** Scalable backend with finality guarantees
- **Cross-Border Payments:** Fast, secure, and cost-effective transactions

---

## 6. Performance Scenarios

- **Conservative (100 nodes):**  
  100 nodes × 100 tx/block × 100 blocks/sec = **1M TPS**
- **Aggressive (1000 nodes):**  
  1000 nodes × 100 tx/block × 100 blocks/sec = **10M TPS**

## 7. Compliance & Security

- FinDAG Time enables microsecond audit trails
- <500ms finality satisfies regulatory reporting demands
- Deterministic ordering ensures fairness, reducing risk of front-running
